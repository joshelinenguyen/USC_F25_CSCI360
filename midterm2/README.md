# Midterm 1 (CSCI 360 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence)

Lab instruction: See P9 & P10 in `Midterm 2 Fall 25.pdf`. Due on Dec 5th, 2025, EOD PT.

**Submission**: Submit your Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to Gradescope. Please ensure that your `.ipynb` file including your code and the output from running all cells.

## Writing Your Code

You can use any Python package that is installed by `pip` or `conda` when you create the environment.

For clarity in your work, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) to organize your work. Use clear Markdown sections to indicate questions, code and results. A template is provided for `.ipynb` files: [CSCI360_MT2_P9_skeleton.ipynb](CSCI360_MT2_P9_skeleton.ipynb) and [CSCI360_MT2_P10_skeleton.ipynb](CSCI360_MT2_P10_skeleton.ipynb). Feel free to do your work in this template. 

**Important**: Ensure your submitted `.ipynb` file includes both code and output from all executed cells, or points will be deducted. We have placed some `print` statements inside the skeleton code; for easier grading purposes, please try not to remove them.
